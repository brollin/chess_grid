# Chess Grid

Chess Grid is an interactive voice-command chess tool intended to be used with the
[Talon Voice framework](https://talonvoice.com/).

Chess Grid will allow you to use voice commands to move pieces on any chess board, such as this one from Lichess:
![normal board](images/board_normal.png)

By saying the command `chess grid`, the chess board will be automatically detected and a grid will be overlaid on top of it:
![board with grid](images/board_grid.png)

Never fear! You can then hide the grid with the command `chess hide`.

You would then be able to move pieces with a command such as `mark each four fine five` to move the pawn from E4 to F5.
